# Appointment

The website offers two types of user accounts: Hospital-Admin and Patient.
Hospital-Admin can access the after-authentication page once the admin has
registered them. Patients can book appointments with multiple doctors, view a list
of hospitals and doctors, search for hospitals and doctors using various criteria
such as name or hospital name, and can also edit their own information.
Hospital-Admin can approve appointments by assigning a time, input multiple
doctors into a hospital, and update doctor information as needed
